# CHAlgorithm

This repository contains the implementation of "Distributed Collaborative Task Allocation via Consensus Hungarian Algorithm". 

The code will be open-sourced after the paper is accepted.

The Hungarian algorithm implementation comes from <https://github.com/mcximing/hungarian-algorithm-cpp>, which is derived from [Markus Buehren's code](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/6543-functions-for-the-rectangular-assignment-problem).
